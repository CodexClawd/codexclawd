## Three Years Out (2028)

**The Vision:**

**Professional:**
- Self-employed
- Stable income from own work
- **NO corporate** — never again
- Possible direction: AI systems for German economy
- Alternative: Something meaningful outside banking entirely

**Personal:**
- Recovery complete or managed
- Better daily structure (ADHD accommodated, not fought)
- Stronger relationships with fuel-people (Manu, Spencer)
- Less isolation, but on your terms

**Lifestyle:**
- Night owl schedule respected (not forced into 9-5)
- Weed usage: managed (not eliminated necessarily, but not running you)
- Self-care: automated/scaffolded, not willpower-based

## The Endgame (If Nothing Was in the Way)

**What Flo Would Build:**

AI systems for the German economy — or something completely outside banking that actually matters. Something that uses your analytical skills without the corporate soul-crushing. Possibly:
- AI automation for small businesses
- Geopolitical analysis tools
- Trading/investment systems
- Something that helps people with ADHD manage their lives (build what you needed)

**The Dream Life:**
- Wake up when you want (night owl)
- Work on meaningful projects
- Income from your own systems/clients
- No bosses, no corporate politics
- Strong connections with fuel-people
- ADHD as a feature, not a bug
