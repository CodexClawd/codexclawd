# Iran-US Tension Daily Brief — February 18, 2026

## Summary

Tensions escalated significantly overnight as Iran began naval drills in the Strait of Hormuz (Feb 16) while Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Geneva for a second round of nuclear talks. President Trump issued an ultimatum: immediate accord or face U.S. attack. The U.S. military is reportedly preparing for potentially weeks-long operations, including strikes on Iranian state and security facilities beyond nuclear sites. Iran continues hardening its nuclear infrastructure and categorically rejects negotiations on ballistic missiles or support for the "Axis of Resistance."

**Volatility spike**: Polymarket odds for U.S. military action by June 30, 2026 remain at 53% (per recent reporting), with a high-profile $64k bet placed on a strike before month-end. Total betting volume exceeds $238 million.

## Probability Changes

- **Short-term (Feb 28 deadline)**: No specific market data retrieved today. Last reported $64k "Yes" bet on February-month strike suggests elevated near-term probability.
- **Medium-term (June 30)**: 53% consensus probability (unchanged from 5-day-old reporting). Market likely pricing in binary outcome: deal or strike before summer.
- **Catalyst timeline**: Geneva talks ongoing. Trump's "immediate accord" demand creates binary pressure window before Feb 28 (your tracked date).

## Catalysts

1. **Diplomatic**: Geneva nuclear talks (today/tomorrow) — success/failure determines immediate trajectory
2. **Military**: IRGC Hormuz drills demonstrate Iranian resolve; U.S. carrier presence + weeks-long ops prep signals readiness
3. **Political**: Trump's public ultimatum reduces flexibility — either Iran caves or strike follows
4. **Market**: $64k insider-sensitive bet on Feb timeframe suggests someone expects escalation ahead of month-end

## Next Watch

- **Tonight/Tomorrow**: Geneva talk outcomes. "No deal" = strike probability jump
- **Feb 21-28**: Wind-down period if talks fail. Look for:
  - U.S. carrier group positioning updates
  - IRGC provocative actions (Hormuz, proxies)
  - Administration rhetoric shifts
- **Market tracking**: Monitor Polymarket for volume spikes and odds movement on February-specific contracts (your manual granularity)
- **Military indicators**: Increased DEFCON levels, State Department travel warnings, embassy evacuations

**Bottom Line**: Binary situation — Feb 28 is a natural pressure valve. Either Trump gets his "immediate accord" or we see escalation. Prepare for rapid movement if Geneva talks collapse.
