## Summary

The US-Israeli military campaign against Iran entered its third consecutive day on March 2, 2026, with sustained airstrikes and confirmed first US casualties. The conflict has escalated beyond initial expectations following the confirmed assassination of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on February 28. Both sides are engaged in active hostilities across multiple domains: Iran has launched ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israel, US bases across the Persian Gulf, and regional partners; meanwhile, US-Israeli forces continue degrading Iran's air defenses and command infrastructure in Tehran and beyond. President Trump announced the operation will last "four or five weeks," signaling protracted warfare. The UN Security Council held emergency sessions but failed to broker de-escalation, with Secretary-General Guterres warning of uncontrollable regional chain reactions.

## Catalysts

1. **Leadership Decapitation** (Feb 28): Khamenei's killing eliminated Iran's top authority, triggering regime collapse fears and hardening Iranian resolve.

2. **Casualty Escalation** (Mar 1): Pentagon confirmed **3 US troops killed, 5 seriously injured**—first American combat deaths of campaign. Iran claims 560 US casualties via missile strikes (unverified).

3. **Prolonged Campaign Declaration** (Mar 1): Trump's "4-5 weeks" timeline transformed expectations from limited strikes to sustained warfare, driving up probability of ground invasion and regional expansion.

4. **Regional Retaliation**: Iran's missile/drone barrage hit **7 countries** (Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Iraq, UAE, Saudi Arabia), including civilian targets (9 killed in Beit Shemesh, Israel). Houthi movement expected to resume Red Sea attacks; Iraqi Kataib Hezbollah vowed strikes on US facilities.

5. **Diplomatic Collapse**: Oman-mediated indirect talks abandoned; UN ceasefire calls rejected by both sides; France warned Iran must "respect international obligations."

## Next Watch

**Immediate (24-48h):**
- Iranian proxy escalation: Monitor Houthi shipping attacks & Iraqi militia strikes on US bases
- Air defense degradation: If IRGC air capabilities collapse, expect Iranian asymmetric retaliation (naval, cyber, terrorism)
- GCC alignment: Will Saudi/UAE publicly support US or seek independent diplomacy?

**Week-Long:**
- Ground invasion indicators: US 82nd Airborne/IDF mobilization for cross-border operations
- Nuclear emergency: Isfahan/Natanz facility strikes or attempted sabotage
- Leadership succession: Does Iran's interim council stabilize or fragment into civil conflict?

**Market Implications:**
- Polymarket: **March 3-7 strike dates** will remain 80%+; watch for ground troop entry bets above 50%
- Oil: Persian Gulf shipping disruptions → Brent > $120/barrel likely
- Safe assets: Gold, USD, Treasuries rally on Middle East risk-off
- Defense stocks: Lockheed, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman on elevated volume

**Information Integrity:**
- Polymarket insider trading investigation ongoing—expect volatility if CFTC/securities regulators intervene
- Iranian casualty figures are propaganda-heavy; verify with OSINT sources (Bellingcat, CENTCOM briefings)
- US domestic political backlash timeline: >30 days of casualties may trigger congressional hearings
