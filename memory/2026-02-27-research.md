## Summary

US-Iran tensions have reached a critical inflection point overnight. The collapse of third-round nuclear talks in Geneva (Feb 26) coincides with unprecedented US military repositioning, signaling a shift from diplomatic pressure to imminent kinetic options. Prediction markets maintain a 35% probability of US strike before March 12 and 70% by year-end, though some Trump advisers assess a "90% chance within weeks." Key Gulf allies have refused basing access, forcing the US to deploy offensive assets to Israel for the first time.

## Probability Changes

**Polymarket US Strike Probabilities:**
- **Before March 12:** ~35% (stable)
- **Before December 31:** ~70% (slight upward drift)
- **Iran Strait Closure:** ~35% by year-end

**Market Interpretation:** The probability curve remains consistent with a "late February to early March" window priced as most likely trigger period. No dramatic overnight jumps detected, but the underlying fundamentals have deteriorated significantly.

## Catalysts

### Military Buildup (Feb 24-27)
- **5th Fleet Evacuation:** Bahrain headquarters reduced to <100 mission-critical personnel; all warships withdrawn from port.
- **Carrier Concentration:** USS Gerald R. Ford joined USS Abraham Lincoln off Israel's coast — two carrier groups in same theater is extraordinarily rare.
- **Offensive Deployment:** 12 F-22 fighters deployed to Ovda Airbase, Israel (first US offensive weapons on Israeli soil).
- **Basing Denials:** Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE refused US strike basing rights, fearing Iranian retaliation.

### Diplomatic Collapse
- **Geneva Talks:** Third round ended Feb 26 with no breakthrough. Omani FM cited "significant progress" but US officials privately assess Iran unlikely to accept US demands.
- **VP Vance Statement (Feb 25):** Public assertion that Iran is "trying to rebuild a nuclear weapon."

### Strategic Posturing
- **Evacuations:** US Embassy in Israel reducing staff; China ordered citizens out of Iran.
- **Israeli Coordination:** Israel positioning as primary US strike platform after Gulf refusals.

## Next Watch

### Immediate (48-72 hours)
- **Final Diplomatic Signals:** Any last-ditch meeting requests from Iran or Omani/Qatar mediators.
- **US Force posture:** Movement of additional air assets to Israel; final carrier positioning.
- **Market Movements:** Polymarket odds breaking 40% before March 12 would signal insider positioning.

### Week Ahead (Feb 28 - Mar 7)
- **Technical Talks in Vienna:** Whether post-Geneva technical discussions yield concrete Iranian concessions.
- **Congressional Notifications:** Required for major strikes; unexpected hearings or briefings.
- **Houthi/Proxy Reactions:** Escalation in Red Sea or Iraq as early warning indicators.

### Structural Risks
- **Escalation Ladder:** CSIS warns limited strikes could spiral despite both sides preferring restraint.
- **Energy Markets:** Strait of Hormuz closure probability (35%) remains a tail risk with massive oil price implications.
- **Regional Spillover:** Israeli-Hezbollah front may activate if US strikes commence.
