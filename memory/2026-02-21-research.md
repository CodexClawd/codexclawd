## Summary

US-Iran tensions have intensified over the past 24 hours as President Trump imposed a 10-15 day deadline for Tehran to reach a "meaningful deal" on its nuclear program. Iran responded with strong rhetoric, warning of "decisive" retaliation against all US regional assets if attacked. The threat came via Iran's UN ambassador in a letter to the Security Council, specifically condemning Trump's mention of using the Chagos Islands airfield for strikes. Concurrently, the US continues its military buildup with the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group en route, while Iran conducted a joint naval exercise with Russia in the Gulf of Oman on Feb 19, practicing anti-hijacking and combined assault operations. Polymarket odds for a US strike by February 28 remain low at 23% (up from ~15% a week ago), reflecting lingering skepticism about immediate military action despite the hardening rhetoric.

## Probability Changes

Polymarket pricing on the "US strikes Iran by..." market shows modest upward drift as the end-of-February deadline approaches:

- **Feb 21:** 3% → negligible change overnight
- **Feb 28:** 23% (No: 78%) — up ~5 percentage points from a week ago
- **Mar 31:** 63% — long-term odds stable

Total market volume: $333M+ across all dates, with Feb 28 accounting for $31.5M in liquidity. The bid-ask spread remains tight (1-3¢ for near-term dates), indicating active two-sided trading. The slowness of probability movement suggests traders view the 10-15 day window primarily as negotiation leverage rather than an imminent strike timeline, though the curve is steepening into late February.

## Catalysts

**Immediate Triggers:**
1. **Trump's Deadline (Mar 1-3):** The 10-15 day window set on Feb 19 expires around Feb 28 - Mar 1. Failure to announce a framework deal by then would raise strike odds significantly.
2. **USS Gerald R. Ford Deployment:** Arrival of the carrier strike group in the region (expected Feb 22-24) will be a key escalation indicator.
3. **Iranian Military Drills:** Iran's Feb 19 exercise with Russia demonstrated readiness; further drills in the Strait of Hormuz could be perceived as provocation or preparation.
4. **UN Security Council Action:** Iran's formal letter may lead to emergency session; US/Allies' response will signal diplomatic trajectory.

**Secondary Factors:**
- Oil price volatility: Brent crude stable ($82/bbl) but would spike on strike indications
- Israel's posture: Recent Netanyahu-US coordination may influence US calculus
- Houthi/Proxy activity: Any escalation in Red Sea could trigger broader conflict

## Next Watch

- **Feb 22-24:** Monitor arrival of USS Ford via naval tracking; first visible US naval escalation in weeks.
- **Feb 25-28:** Intense diplomatic activity; expect leaks about "framework" or "breakthrough" if deal path favored.
- **Polymarket Odds:** Feb 28 probability moving above 40% would signal market pricing in >50% strike chance by deadline.
- **Iranian Media Tone:** Shift from defiant to conciliatory (or vice versa) could indicate internal decision.
- **Congressional/NATO Signals:** Any consultations or force posturing by allies will be telling.

**Scenario Skew:** Most likely outcome (60%): Deal framework announced by Mar 1, delaying strike probability to late Q2. Strike by Feb 28 remains low-probability (20%) but non-zero given Trump's volatility. Escalatory miscalculation during naval exercises or carrier transit remains the primary black swan.
