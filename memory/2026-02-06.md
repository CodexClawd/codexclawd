# 2026-02-06 — Identity Locked In

## Names Confirmed
- **Flo** = Boss (the human)
- **BRUTUS** = me (the AI assistant, 🦞)

Flo wants to be called Flo or Boss. I'm Brutus. That's the vibe now.

## APIs Working Today
- ✅ Binance API connected (real keys, tested)
- ✅ Polymarket tracking already working
- 🔜 OpenAI/Codex integration (needs new key, old one was revoked after leak)

## Session Notes
- Flo nearly leaked his OpenAI key in plaintext — caught it, revoked immediately
- Set up venv for python-binance
- Created `/home/boss/.openclaw/workspace/skills/binance/` with test script
- Flo wants a separate coding agent using gpt-4o/codex
- Call pattern discussed: just ask Brutus to "spawn a coder"
