# Iran-US Tension Daily Research - February 17, 2026

**Report Time:** 01:30 UTC | **Source:** Macro Research Agent | **Focus:** US-Iran Strike Markets (Feb 9 & 28)

---

## Summary

US-Iran tensions remain **elevated** with military preparations accelerating on both sides. The Trump administration has set a **roughly one-month deadline** for a nuclear deal, while Iran categorically rejects negotiation on its ballistic missile program—frames it as a "firmly established" red line and core defense doctrine. The US is deploying a **second carrier strike group** to the Middle East, signaling preparedness for extended operations. Polymarket odds for US military action before February 28 stand at **16%** (Middle East Eye, Feb 13), though this data is now 4 days old and may be stale. The February 9 market has already expired without resolution.

## Probability Changes

### Polymarket Odds (Latest Available)
- **Feb 28 market:** 16% chance of US strike before month-end (as of Feb 13)
- **June 2026 market:** 53% chance of US attack by end of Q2 (as of Feb 13)

### Status Notes
- **Feb 9 position**: Expired without resolution (market likely resolved "No")
- **Feb 28 position**: Still active, but probability low at last reading
- Market data **manual tracking required** (Polymarket APIs don't index 2026 futures)

### Probability Trajectory

- **Upward pressure** from military buildup and Trump's "one month" ultimatum
- Net effect: Likely range-bound 10-20% until catalyst event

## Catalysts

### Immediate Triggers (Next 72h)
1. **Geneva Nuclear Talks (Feb 17)** — Resumption could shift odds either way
2. **Iran ballistic missile response** — Any escalation will spike probabilities
3. **US carrier deployment confirmation** — Second carrier arrival in region

### Medium-Term Catalysts
1. **Trump's one-month deadline** — Approaching late-February creates binary outcome
2. **Iranian diplomatic posture** — Any hint of flexibility on missiles = odds drop
3. **Regional proxy action** — Houthi/Hezbollah escalation could trigger US response

### Notable Developments (Last 7 Days)
- Iran staged **limited retaliatory strike** on US base in Qatar (Feb 13)
- Iran's Defense Council Secretary Shamkhani: ballistic missiles are **"non-negotiable"**
- US military preparing for **"weeks-long operations"** per Reuters (Feb 13)
- Israeli insider betting scandal on Polymarket markets revealed—raises integrity questions

## Next Watch

### Priority Monitoring
1. **Geneva talks outcome** — Success/failure moves markets
2. **February 28 deadline** — Final week will see volatility spike
3. **Carrier group movements** — Publicly trackable via maritime feeds

### Recommended Check-in Schedule
- **Daily**: News sweep on Iran-US developments
- **Every 48h**: Manual Polymarket probability capture
- **Feb 25-27**: Intensify monitoring for last-minute developments

### For Flo's Position
- **Feb 9 contracts**: Likely expired worthless (no strike occurred by Feb 9)
- **Feb 28 contracts**: 16% odds at last read—position underwater relative to implied probability
- Consider **exit strategy** if odds drop below 10% or diplomatic breakthrough occurs
- Portfolio value update pending manual market check

### Risk Flags
- **Market manipulation risk**: Recent insider betting arrests suggest Polymarket may be volatile/stale
- **News-driven moves**: Single event (e.g., attack on US asset) could send odds to 80%+ in hours
- **Resolution ambiguity**: Polymarket dispute resolution could affect payout even if strike occurs

---

## Bottom Line

Tension remains high but **diplomatic track still active**. Near-term strike probability low per markets, but **black swan risk elevated** given military buildup. February 28 market likely represents final near-term opportunity—watch closely.
