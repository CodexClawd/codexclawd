## Summary

US-Iran tensions have escalated dramatically overnight, with prediction markets repricing conflict odds at unprecedented speed. Polymarket now assigns 38-40% probability for a US strike by **February 28** and 49-66% by **March 31**, representing 32% surges in recent days. The White House is signaling "many arguments" for military action while diplomatic talks continue—a classic good cop/bad cop dynamic. Israel is preparing for war "within days," and the US is positioning assets including the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier group and 50+ fighter jets in the region. Iran is fortifying military sites and closed the Strait of Hormuz today.

**Bottom line:** Smart money now sees late February to end-March as the highest-probability strike window. A 90% chance of kinetic action in "next few weeks" is being quoted by Trump advisers.

## Probability Changes (Polymarket)

| Target Date | Current Probability | Recent Move | Δ Points |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Feb 21 | ~20% | Up 8 points | +8% |
| Feb 28 | 38-40% | Jumped sharply | ~+15% |
| March 15 | 55% | Spike of 28 points in one day | +28% |
| March 31 | 49-66% | 32% surge flagged | +32% |
| June 30 | 67% | Up 15 points | +15% |

**Key observation:** The steepest probability acceleration is in March 31 and March 15 contracts, while Feb 28 remains below 40%. Market skepticism about "immediate" weekend strikes (per Yadlin warning) but clear flagging of late March as explosive window.

## Catalysts (Last 24h)

### Diplomatic Front
- **Second Geneva round** concluded with Iran claiming "guiding principles" agreement, but US officials note "still far apart on issues"
- Vice President JD Vance: diplomacy could reach "natural end" if Iran fails nuclear red lines
- No date set for third round; talks showing limited progress despite public optimism

### Military Posturing
- **USS Gerald R. Ford** deployed to Middle East; 50+ fighter jets prepositioned
- **Diego Garcia**: Trump threatened to use the UK base (and RAF Fairford) for Iran strikes in Truth Social post, warning Starmer against Chagos Islands handover
- Satellite imagery confirms Diego Garcia surge activity: 6+ military aircraft on runway as of Feb 18
- Israel's IDF Home Front Command briefed Knesset; public told to prepare for "challenging days"

### Iranian Response
- **NOTAM issued** for planned rocket launches today (Feb 19)
- **Strait of Hormuz** temporarily closed (announcement Mar 3 AM IST)
- Fortification efforts: concrete shields over sensitive sites, per Reuters satellite analysis
- Khamenei issued warnings to US over "military buildup"
- Fire reported near Tehran (Parand area) – cause unclear

### Market Signals

## Next Watch

### Immediate Triggers (48-72h)
- **Rocket launch NOTAM execution** (expected Feb 19) – could test US response thresholds
- **Diego Garcia* activity spikes** – follow-on deployments would signal operational tempo increase
- **Third round nuclear talks** – cancellation = escalation signal; agreement = probability drop
- **Strauss/Hormuz reop* status** – prolonged closure = economic warfare escalation

### Week Ahead (Feb 20-28)
- **Feb 21 Polymarket close** – watch for break above 25% (accelerates Feb 28 reprice)
- **Rubio-Netanyahu meeting** (Feb 28) – joint operation coordination likely
- **Iranian missile tests** – expected after NOTAM; timing critical
- **White House messaging** – Vance/Rubio statements as leading indicator

### Key Levels
- **Feb 28 Polymarket >45%** → Strike window shifts from "possible" to "likely"
- **March 15 >60%** → Imminent operational phase (weeks away)
- **March 31 >70%** → High confidence of kinetic action in March

### Risk Reversal
Watch for: sudden probability *decline* + diplomatic breakthrough + US asset de-escalation (carrier withdrawal, jet recall). Currently no such signals.
