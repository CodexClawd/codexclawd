## Executive Summary

**Regime Status:** DORMANT → SHIFTING — Central banks remain in quiet periods, but overnight commentary reveals growing divergence between data resilience and easing expectations. Market pricing inflation-sensitive cuts despite strong US fundamentals.

**Key Development:** Fed speakers maintain easing bias conditional on inflation convergence, while BOE's 5-4 split underscores internal tension. EUR repo line permanence signals ECB's shift to structural liquidity tools amid geopolitical concerns.

## Regime Classification

**Current Regime:** EASING BIAS FORMING — Data resilience complicating but not overturning rate-cut expectations. Central banks in quiet periods with speakers conditioning moves on inflation progress.

**Key Tensions:**
1. **Fed:** Strong US data (payrolls, earnings) vs. market pricing >2 cuts; Goolsbee signals conditional cuts if inflation reaches 2%
2. **BoE:** Narrow 5-4 hold vote, core inflation still ~3%, labor softening → March decision pivotal
3. **ECB:** Lagarde shifts to permanent repo lines (structural tool) → signaling longer-term balance sheet management
4. **SNB:** Persistent CHF strength despite low rates → potential intervention risk

**Risk Factors:**
- US CPI/PCE prints above expectations (next data: Feb 28 PCE)
- Fed speaker pushback on June cut pricing
- BoE March vote composition (unexpected hawk/dovish shift)
- Geopolitical escalation → safe-haven flows (CHF, JPY, gold)
- Tariff rulings from US Supreme Court (Feb 20-25)

## Digest Contribution (Flagged for 06:45 Briefing)

**Headline:** Overnight: CB Speakers Maintain Easing Bias Despite Data Resilience; March Looms

**Key Points:**
- **Fed:** Goolsbee says cuts still viable if inflation hits 2%, but services inflation remains "pretty high" → June cut pricing intact for now
- **ECB:** Lagarde (Munich) announces permanent EUR repo lines from 3Q2026 → structural liquidity tool amid geopolitical stress
- **BoE:** 5-4 February hold vote revealed; Pill says rates "a little too low" but hold correct → UK CPI Wed critical for March
- **Market:** US yields down 15bp last week (10Y), 2Y at 3.4% (lowest since 2022); markets price 3 Fed cuts in 2026 (up from 2)
- **FX:** JPY +3%, AUD +0.9% weekly; CHF strength bias persists (UBS EUR/CHF 0.95 in 12m)

**Regime Shift:** DORMANT → EASING BIAS FORMING (market pricing accelerating, CBs not pushing back forcefully)

**Action Required:** Watch Fed speakers this week for consistency; UK CPI Wed (expected 3.0% core); monitor US tariff ruling dates (Feb 20-25).
