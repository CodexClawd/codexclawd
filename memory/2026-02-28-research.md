## Summary

A dramatic overnight shift in prediction markets signals waning confidence in imminent US-Iran strike, even as military posture remains at peak readiness. Polymarket odds for a US strike by March 1 (tomorrow) dropped to approximately 26% from ~35% previously, while President Trump publicly expressed dissatisfaction with negotiations but indicated "additional talks today." The evacuation of US embassy staff from Israel today suggests strike preparations continue even as probability contracts retrace. Oil prices surged 2.8% to $67/barrel, reflecting sustained geopolitical risk premium.

## Probability Changes

**Polymarket US Strike Probabilities (Major Overnight Shift):**
- **By March 1, 2026:** ~26% (down from ~35%)
- **By March 12, 2026:** Est. ~30% (implied, down from 35%)
- **By December 31, 2026:** ~70% (unchanged)

**Market Interpretation:** The probability curve has flattened significantly for the ultra-short-term window (March 1), suggesting traders believe diplomacy may get a final chance this weekend. However, the year-end probability remains elevated at 70%, indicating a strong consensus that strikes remain likely in 2026. The divergence between market odds and on-ground preparations creates a fascinating arbitrage opportunity that may resolve this weekend.

## Catalysts

### Diplomatic Movement (Feb 27-28)
- **Trump Statement (Feb 27):** "Not happy" with negotiations; Iran "not negotiating in good faith"; announced "additional talks today" (Feb 28).
- **Final Push:** Administration signaling both pressure and openness to last-minute deal.
- **Omani/Qatar Mediation:** Unknown if new proposals on table.

### Military Posture (Unchanged but Critical)
- **Two Carrier Groups:** USS Gerald R. Ford + USS Abraham Lincoln off Israel coast.
- **F-22 Deployment:** 12 offensive fighters on Israeli soil (first-ever).
- **5th Fleet:** Bahrain HQ skeleton crew; all warships withdrawn.
- **Basing Denials:** Gulf allies (Saudi, Qatar, UAE) still refusing strike rights; Israel remains sole platform.

### Evacuations & Signals
- **US Embassy Israel:** Staff told to leave "TODAY" (Feb 28) per Ambassador Huckabee email.
- **Citizen Advisories:** US, China, others urging citizens to leave region.
- **Market Reaction:** Oil +2.8% to $67/barrel; stocks down on Iran war fears.

## Next Watch

### Today (Feb 28) - Critical 24 Hours
- **"Additional Talks":** Any breakthrough or complete collapse will move markets dramatically.
- **Evacuation Completion:** Whether US embassy staffing drops to emergency levels.
- **Weekend Posturing:** Any movement of additional assets to Israel before March 1.

### Week Ahead (March 1-7)
- **March 1 Deadline:** If no strike by tomorrow, short-term probability resets to near zero; focus shifts to March 12.
- **Vienna Technical Talks:** Whether they proceed or are cancelled.
- **Congressional Activity:** Unexpected briefings or war powers discussions.
- **Proxy Activity:** Houthi, Iraqi militia reactions to US posture.

### Deception Risk
**High probability of false flag or intentional market manipulation:** The disconnect between falling prediction market odds and escalating evacuation orders suggests either (a) markets correctly pricing a diplomatic window, or (b) intentional misdirection to reduce market-anticipation costs. Monitor for sudden probability spikes late weekend.

**Key Takeaway:** Probability of March 1 strike collapsed to 26% overnight while evacuation orders intensified. Two possibilities: (1) genuine last-ditch diplomacy creating temporary calm, or (2) tactical deception. Watch March 1-2 for resolution.
