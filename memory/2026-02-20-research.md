## Summary

US-Iran tensions remain at critical inflection point with President Trump issuing a 10-15 day ultimatum (deadline ≈ March 2-5) for a nuclear deal while simultaneously building an unprecedented two-carrier naval presence in the Middle East. Despite the bellicose military posture, prediction market odds for a February strike have **declined to 26%** for month-end (from ~40%+ earlier in February), suggesting traders believe diplomatic leverage remains viable. Iran has accelerated defensive hardening with concrete shields over sensitive facilities. The next 10-14 days constitute the decision window.

### Risk Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Trigger | Market Impact |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Deal by March 5** | 40% | Iran accepts missile limits | Oil -10%, Strike odds collapse to <10% |
| **Limited US strike (early March)** | 35% | Deadline passes, symbolic attack | Oil +15-20%, Strike odds → 70%+ |
| **Strike postponed to April+** | 15% | Extension granted, forces build | Strike odds shift to May/June markets |
| **Accidental escalation** | 10% | Naval incident, proxy attack | Immediate spike, panic buying |

## Bottom Line

The market is **underpricing March risk**. With 60% probability by March 31 and forces massing, the real decision point arrives in early March. If Iran's written response falls short, expect rapid odds re-pricing. Monitor Polymarket volume spikes on Feb 28 → Mar 1 transition as early indicator.

**Confidence**: Medium (high on facts, moderate on interpretation due to opaque diplomatic track)
