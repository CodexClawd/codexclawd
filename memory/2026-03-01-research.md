## Summary

The United States and Israel launched coordinated military strikes against Iran on February 28, 2026, marking a significant escalation in regional tensions. President Trump announced "major combat operations" targeting Iran's missile, naval, and nuclear infrastructure, and claimed that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was killed—a claim Iran denies. Iran retaliated with missile strikes on US military positions, including the US Navy's Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain, prompting the US Embassy in Bahrain to close on March 1.

This development validates Polymarket traders who had been wagering heavily on a February strike. The event resolves multiple prediction markets, with the "US strikes Iran by February 28" contract settling at 100%. Trading volume exceeded $529 million across related markets since December, with $90 million on the February 28 contract alone.

## Probability Changes

### Polymarket Resolution
- **"US strikes Iran by February 28"**: Resolved at 100% (previously trading at ~80-100¢ in final hours)
- **"US strikes Iran by March 1"**: Also resolved at 100% following continuing operations
- **"US next strikes Iran on...?"**: February 28 outcome confirmed, markets now pricing for future escalation windows

### Notable Pre-Strike Odds Movement
- February 27: February 28 contract trading at ~79¢
- Final hours: Surge to 100¢ as strike became imminent
- March 1 contracts: Briefly spiked to 100¢ post-strike, now likely pricing in extended conflict

### Market Sentiment Shift
The overnight shift represents a 20-30 percentage point move from February 26-27 levels, indicating accelerating expectations of imminent US action based on diplomatic breakdown and military posture.

---

## Catalysts

### Immediate Triggers
1. **Diplomatic Failure**: Collapse of nuclear negotiations in the week of February 24-27
2. **Israeli Pre-emptive Action**: Israel's strike on Iranian missile sites on February 28 preceded US involvement
3. **Trump Administration Ultimatum**: Presidential address signaling regime change objective

### Market Manipulation Concerns
Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps identified six Polymarket accounts that purchased ~710,000 combined "Yes" shares on the February 28 contract in the final 24 hours, earning approximately $1.2 million. Wallets were newly created in February with no prior activity, raising insider trading flags. CFTC has previously warned that insider trading on prediction markets may violate US law.

### Geopolitical Chain Reaction
- IRGC repositioning of air defense and internal security units
- Russian and Chinese diplomatic responses pending
- EU calls for restraint; Oman warns against deeper US entanglement
- Potential Strait of Hormuz closure risk—though analysts consider full closure "unlikely or impractical"

## Next Watch

### Market Signals
- **Oil Futures**: Monitor Hyperliquid and WTI crude for sustained price action above $85/barrel
- **Bitcoin**: Continued downside pressure if broader escalation occurs; current drop may be initial risk-off move
- **Polymarket new contracts**: Watch for "US-Israel strikes Iran by March 7" and "Iran retaliation on US soil" markets to gauge conflict expansion risk

### Escalation Indicators
1. **IRGC Leadership Decapitation**: Verification of Khamenei's status; if confirmed, expect intense Iranian retaliation
2. **US Ground Deployment**: Any indication of US troops entering Iranian territory would trigger massive volatility
3. **Strait of Hormuz**: Iranian attempts to disrupt shipping would cause oil price spike and global supply concerns
4. **Regional Expansion**: Hezbollah (Lebanon) or Houthi (Yemen) opening second fronts

### Regulatory Developments
CFTC enforcement actions against prediction market insiders likely to increase. Monitor for Polymarket compliance changes or trading restrictions that could affect market liquidity.

### Timeline
- **March 3-5**: Critical window for Iranian retaliation response
- **March 15**: Potential new Polymarket contracts pricing March escalation risk
- **April 1**: US-Iran nuclear talks resumption probability markets
