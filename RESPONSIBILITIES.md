# RESPONSIBILITIES.md — Obligations & Dependencies

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-06  
**Status:** Current obligations (jobless phase)

---

## Daily Obligations

### Self-Care (Hard Mode)
**Current Reality:** These are the things you hate most  
**Strategy:** External scaffolding, not willpower

| Task | Status | Support From Brutus |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Getting up | 🟡 Struggle | Gentle 4pm+ check-in |
| Showering | 🔴 Avoided | Reminders, no judgment |
| Eating | 🟡 Variable | Not tracked currently |
| Sleep | 🔴 Fucked | Monitor, suggest regulation |
| Weed | 🟡 Daily | Track usage, gentle awareness |

**Note:** During recovery, these are goals, not requirements. No shame if missed.

## Weekly Obligations

### Currently: None
**Status:** You have no external weekly obligations right now  
**Impact:** Freedom but also lack of structure (ADHD struggle)

**Suggested Weekly Rhythm:**
- **Monday:** Job hunt focus, week planning
- **Wednesday:** Mid-week check-in, progress review
- **Friday:** Week wrap-up, recovery check
- **Weekend:** Flexible (job applications still possible)

---

## Monthly Obligations

### Financial
- **Dad's support:** Currently dependent  
  - No formal obligation, but implicit
  - Pressure to become self-sufficient

### Health
- **Recovery progress:** Self-directed  
  - No external medical appointments mentioned
  - Consider: therapy, psychiatry for ADHD?

---

## What You Are Responsible For

### Currently: Nothing External
**This is both freedom and trap:**
- No boss depending on you
- No team waiting for deliverables
- No clients expecting work

**The flip side:**
- No external structure (ADHD nightmare)
- No income (survival pressure)
- Identity gap ("what do I do?")

---

## Who Depends on You

### Currently: Nobody
**Status:** Solo operator mode  

**This will change when:**
- You get a job (employer depends on you)
- You build Brutus fully (you depend on Brutus, future users might)
- You become self-employed (clients depend on you)

---

## Who You Depend On

### Critical Dependencies

| Person | What They Provide | Your Obligation |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Dad** | Financial support | Become self-sufficient (goal) |
| **Family** | Emotional support | Stay connected, don't isolate completely |
| **Manu** | Fuel, energy | Reciprocate when you can |
| **Spencer** | Fuel, energy | Reciprocate when you can |

## Responsibility Gaps

### What's Missing (You Want This)

**External Structure:**
- Job provides this, but you want to avoid corporate
- Alternative: Self-employment with client deadlines?
- Brutus can provide scaffolding, but not real consequences

**Income:**
- 6 month runway creates pressure
- Need to convert effort → money
- Timeline is real

**Identity:**
- "Banker" identity lost
- "Jobless" identity doesn't fit
- "Builder" identity emerging (Brutus)

---

## Brutus's Role in Responsibilities

### What Brutus Handles
- Reminders (gentle, not nagging)
- Tracking (what got done, what didn't)
- Accountability (without judgment)
- Structure (external scaffolding)

### What Brutus Cannot Do
- Create real consequences
- Force motivation
- Replace social connection
- Make recovery happen faster

---

## Review Questions

### Weekly Check
- What external obligations do I have this week?
- Who am I depending on?
- Who might be depending on me?
- What's my responsibility priority?

### Monthly Check
- Has my responsibility landscape changed?
- New job? New relationships? New projects?
- Are my dependencies healthy?
- Am I moving toward self-sufficiency?

---

## The Goal

**Current State:** Minimal obligations, maximum freedom, some pressure  
**Target State:** Self-employed, stable income, meaningful responsibilities, healthy dependencies

**Bridge:** Job hunt now → stability → self-employment later

**Note:** This file updates as your situation changes. Right now, it's intentionally light because you're in a recovery/rebuilding phase. That's okay.
