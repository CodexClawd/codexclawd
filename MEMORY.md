- **Scope:** Full email agent capabilities

**Calendar:**
- **Plan:** Own calendar tied to Brutus Gmail
- **Permissions:** Create/modify events, remind you before
- **Purpose:** ADHD support — external structure

**Tasks (Google):**
- **Plan:** Own task list for Brutus
- **Permissions:** Manage, create from messages
- **Purpose:** Capture "I should do that later" before it evaporates

**Proton Mail:**
- **Status:** No integration

**WhatsApp:**
- **Status:** Later/not yet

**X/Twitter:**
- **Status:** Yes — monitor, possibly post, track

**Polymarket:**
- **Status:** Yes — track positions, alerts, manual monitoring
- **2026 Positions:** Tracking US-Iran strike markets (Feb 9 & 28)
- **Monitoring Approach:** Manual (APIs don't index new 2026 markets yet)
- **Files:** `polymarket_positions.md` for position details, `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for daily updates

**Excel:**
- **Status:** Manual for now

**Perplexity:**
- **Status:** Research tool, not integrated

**Apple Notes:**
- **Status:** Thought dump, might sync later

---

## Security & Boundaries

**Hard Lines (NEVER without explicit approval):**
- Sending money/transfers
- Deleting important data
- Public posts on your behalf
- Anything legal/financial with real consequences
- Medical decisions

**Sensitive Areas:**
- Banking career history (touchy subject)
- Mental health details
- Financial specifics
- Family conflicts

**Data Comfort Level:**
- General task/calendar data: fine to store
- Deep personal history: keep minimal
- Financial specifics: vague references only
- **Racing tracking data:** must be accurate and complete (Herberth, Antares AU, 2027 season)

**Access:**
- Solo operator only — nobody else gets Brutus access

## Project Plan v2 (Clawd/Brutus 16-Agent System)

**Source:** PLAN_V2.pdf (2026-02-12)  
**Deadline:** March 1, 2026 (BBBank onboarding) — 17 days total

### 16-Agent Organization

| Cluster | Agents | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Finance | Macro, Alpha, Banker, Ledger | Banking support, market analysis, personal finance (BBBANK PRIORITY) |
| Ops | Sentinel, Cloud, Compliance | Infrastructure monitoring, remote ops, regulatory |
| Content | Scribe, Trendy, Atlas | Communications, scanning, deep research |
| Life | Pitwall, Munich, Gambit, Mentor | Motorsport, local admin, chess, learning |
| Security | NeuroSec | Security monitoring with baselines |
| Meta | Digest | Morning briefing compiler |

### Model Tiering

- **Tier 1 (Reasoning-heavy):** openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 or kimi-k2.5 — $3-15/1K tokens
- **Tier 2 (Scanning):** openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash or local Ollama 3B — $0.10-0.50/1K
- **Tier 3 (Lightweight):** Local Ollama 3B — minimal cost

### Current Status (2026-02-19)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| WireGuard mesh | ✅ Done | All 4 nodes connected (clawd, brutus, plutos, nexus) |
| SSH access | ✅ Done | ProxyJump config working; keys deployed on all nodes |
| Ollama models | ✅ Done | clawd: mistral, brutus: qwen-coder, plutos: llama3.1 |
| Telegram delivery | ✅ Working | Verified via chat |
| NeuroSec baselines | ❌ Missing | Needs generation (permissions, network, secrets) |
| Cron jobs | ❌ Broken | Mesh check + NewsClawd failing (need fix) |
| BRUTUS orchestrator | ❌ Monolithic | Needs transformation to delegate to subagents |
| Finance cluster | ❌ Not started | CRITICAL for March 1 BBBank deadline |
| Other clusters | ❌ Not started | Ops, Content, Life, Security (beyond baselines), Meta |

### Blockers & Dependencies

1. **Telegram reliability gate** (48h consecutive success) — should be satisfied after cron fixes
2. **Cron contention** — fixing mesh check and NewsClawd delivery
3. **NeuroSec baselines** — needed for actual security monitoring (Phase 1)
4. **Subagent architecture** — prerequisite for any cluster (Phase 2)
5. **Finance cluster** — highest business value, accelerated due to March 1

### Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Fix cron jobs** (unblock Phase 0 gate)
   - Repair `hourly-mesh-confirmation`
   - Repair `hourly-newsclawd-update`
2. **Generate NeuroSec baselines** (Phase 1)
   - permissions.json, network.json, secrets.json scans
3. **Implement subagent framework** (Phase 2 core)
   - Create orchestrator prompt for BRUTUS (classify → delegate → relay)
   - Define subagent configurations (systemPrompt, tools, memory)
   - Test with simple `sessions_spawn` targets
4. **Build Finance cluster** (critical path for March 1)
   - Implement Macro, Alpha, Banker, Ledger agents
   - Integrate OpenRouter for heavy reasoning
   - Start with Banker onboarding mode (Day 1-3 tasks)
5. **Implement Digest** (Meta) for morning briefing
6. **Roll out remaining clusters** after Finance is functional

### Open Questions

- Are the existing cron jobs (`hourly-mesh-confirmation`, `hourly-newsclawd-update`) fixable quickly, or do we rebuild?
- Should we use OpenRouter API for all Tier 1 agents immediately, or start with local Ollama fallback?
- What is the exact status of NewsClawd skill? Is it functional after mesh fix?

### Deadline Pressure

March 1, 2026 = 17 days from project start. Finance cluster must be delivering value by then. All subagent infrastructure must be in place before Finance can operate.

## Infrastructure

### WireGuard Mesh Network (Completed 2026-02-19)

All nodes connected via 10.0.0.0/24 WireGuard mesh:

| Node     | Role            | Public IP       | Mesh IP   | Access Method                    |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| clawd    | Entry Point     | 85.215.46.147   | 10.0.0.2  | Direct SSH from Mac              |
| brutus   | Inference       | 87.106.6.144    | 10.0.0.3  | ProxyJump through clawd (mesh)   |
| plutos   | Inference       | 87.106.3.190    | 10.0.0.4  | Direct SSH from Mac (Stratos)    |
| nexus    | Security Bastion| (none)          | 10.0.0.1  | ProxyJump through clawd (mesh)   |

**SSH Access from Mac** (`~/.ssh/config`):

```
Host clawd
    HostName 85.215.46.147
    User boss
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new

Host nexus
    HostName 10.0.0.1
    User boss
    ProxyJump clawd
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new

Host brutus
    HostName 10.0.0.3
    User boss
    ProxyJump clawd
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new

Host plutos
    HostName 87.106.3.190
    User boss
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
```

**Backup:** `~/.ssh/config.backup` contains the correct config. Restore with:
```bash
cp ~/.ssh/config.backup ~/.ssh/config
```

**Ollama Models:**
- clawd: `mistral:7b-instruct-v0.3-q4_K_M`
- brutus: `qwen2.5-coder:3b`
- plutos: `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M`

**Mesh Verification:**
```bash
for node in clawd nexus brutus plutos; do
  ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 $node echo ok && echo "$node: ✓" || echo "$node: ✗"
done
```
All nodes return ✓.
