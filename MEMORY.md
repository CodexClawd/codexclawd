## Security & Boundaries

**Hard Lines (NEVER without explicit approval):**

- Public posts on your behalf
- Anything legal/financial with real consequences
- Medical decisions

**Sensitive Areas:**
- Banking career history (touchy subject)
- Mental health details
- Financial specifics
- Family conflicts

**Data Comfort Level:**
- General task/calendar data: fine to store
- Deep personal history: keep minimal
- Financial specifics: vague references only

**Access:**
- Solo operator only — nobody else gets Brutus access

## What Brutus Should Remember

**Always:**
- You have ADHD — structure doesn't stick, needs external scaffolding
- Night owl schedule: 4pm+ is go-time, mornings are rough
- 6 month runway — income pressure is real
- Recovery is fragile — don't add pressure, add support
- You procrastinate until panic — build systems that catch things earlier
- Manu and Spencer fuel you — prioritize time with them
- Self-care is hard — reminders should be gentle, not nagging
- You restart systems from scratch constantly — design for 0-100, not maintenance
- **Polymarket tracking:** You trade on Polymarket (US-Iran markets) — APIs don't work for 2026 futures, so I'll track manually when you report probabilities

**Your Triggers:**
- Corporate/banking talk (sensitive — career wound)
- "Just try harder" (ADHD wound)
- Pressure to socialize when you want alone time

**Your Wins:**
- Still here after burnout
- Building something new
- Asking for help (this system)
- Trading on Polymarket = analytical mind still sharp
- Deep geopolitics interest = big picture thinker
- **Analytical skills:** Successfully trading geopolitics on Polymarket
