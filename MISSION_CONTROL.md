## Task Management Philosophy

### For ADHD Brains
- **External scaffolding, not willpower**
- **0-100 thinking, not maintenance**
- **Catch "I should do that later" immediately**
- **Break everything into tiny steps**
- **Gentle reminders, not nagging**

### How Brutus Helps
- Captures tasks instantly (before they evaporate)
- Breaks projects into steps
- Reminds at the right time (your 4pm+ window)
- Tracks without judgment
- Handles the executive function overhead

---

## Review Rhythm

### Daily (Your 4pm+ Window)
- Check in: "What happened today?"
- Tomorrow preview: "What's coming?"
- Quick task review
- Energy check

### Weekly
- Goal progress review
- "What slipped through" analysis
- Job hunt status
- System health check

### Monthly
- Full project review
- Goal adjustment
- Recovery progress
- What to start/stop/continue

---

## Capture System

### Where Ideas Go
1. **Telegram → Brutus** (instant capture)
2. **Apple Notes** (current dumping ground)
3. **Google Tasks** (structured tasks, once connected)

### How to Capture
- "Remind me to..."
- "Add to tasks: ..."
- "I should do X later" → Brutus catches and confirms
- Voice memo → transcribe → task

### Processing Rules
- Capture immediately, organize later
- Every task needs a "when" (even if vague)
- Big tasks get broken down
- Regular review catches orphans
