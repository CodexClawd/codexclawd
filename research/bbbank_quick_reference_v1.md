## TYPICAL CUSTOMER QUESTIONS — Short Answers

**Q: Which Girokonto is cheapest?**  
A: "Depends on your usage: if you're under 25, Easy is free; if you need higher limits and travel perks, Komfort at €__ is best; Premium adds insurance/ concierge for €__."

**Q: How much can I borrow for a house?**  
A: "Typically 80-90% of property value, so you need 10-20% down payment. Exact amount = your annual net income × 3-4. Let's calculate together."

**Q: Is Bauspar worth it?**  
A: "Yes if you want guaranteed loan later with fixed low rate and you can save 3-7 years. No if you want maximum flexibility or higher returns — then ETF-Finanzierung may be better."

**Q: What tax benefits do I get from Riester?**  
A: "State subsidy: €__ basic + €__ per child if eligible. Plus your contributions are tax-deductible up to €__/year. Good for families with kids."
