Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nBelow 98 cents means the candles have a final “High” price below 0.98000 (i.e. 0.97999 or lower). A 24h period of BUSD below 98 cents that starts on the last day will count (e.g. 01 Apr '23 22:00 to 02 Apr '23 22:00).\n\nThe resolution source for this market is https://www.coinbase.com/, specifically the BUSD-USD “High” prices currently available at https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/BUSD-USD with “1m” and “Candles” selected on the top bar. To see the “High” prices, mouse over particular candles and look at the value after “H” at the top of the chart.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Coinbase BUSD-USD. If Coinbase stops having the necessary BUSD information to resolve this market, a consensus of credible sources for whether BUSD was below 98 cents for 24h+ may be used to resolve this market.",

      "question": "zkSync airdrop by June 1?",
      "description": "This is a market on whether zkSync (https://zksync.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by June 1, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet, actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet, but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by June 1, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.",

      "question": "Will 'Cocaine Bear' gross more than $16 million domestically on opening weekend?",
      "description": "'Cocaine Bear' (2023) is an upcoming American thriller film produced by Universal Pictures. It follows the exploits of a series of unlikely characters who end up in a forest with a bear who unintentionally ingested a large amount of cocaine. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on February 24, 2023.\n\nThis is a market on how much ‘Cocaine Bear' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt14209916/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Feb 24-26) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ‘Cocaine Bear’ grosses more than $16,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 13, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

      "description": "This is a market on whether Metamask (https://metamask.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by December 31, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet (any mainnet in this case), actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (any mainnet, in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. Any gas fees involved in claiming the airdrop will not count as cost for the purposes of resolving this market. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by May 31, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.",

If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc).

      "question": "Arbitrum airdrop by March 31st?",
      "description": "In Response to Trader Inquiry: This market still resolves to \"Yes\" if users need to pay a standard gas fee to claim the airdrop.\n\nThis is a market on whether Arbitrum (https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by March 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet (any Arbitrum mainnet in this case, currently Arbitrum One and/or Arbitrum Nova), actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (either mainnet, in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by March 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.\n",

It is the sixth installment of the Scream series, and follows the survivors of the Ghostface killings as they leave Woodsboro behind to start a fresh chapter in New York City. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on March 10, 2023.\n\nThis is a market on how much ‘Scream VI' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1714914049/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Mar 10 - 12) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ‘Scream VI’ grosses more than $40,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 27, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

      "description": "This is a market on whether zkSync (https://zksync.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by June 1, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet, actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet, but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by June 1, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.",

If uninsured depositors are made whole via any other method (i.e. government bailout, merger or acquisition, etc.), this market will also resolve to “Yes.” \n\nIf depositors are not made whole by June 30, 2023, the market will resolve to “No.” \n\nThe resolution source will be the FDIC, other government-related entities direct reporting, and SVB direct reporting. A consensus of credible reporting will also suffice.",

The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt14209916/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Feb 24-26) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ‘Cocaine Bear’ grosses more than $20,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 13, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

      "description": "This is a market on whether Metamask (https://metamask.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by December 31, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet (any mainnet in this case), actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (any mainnet, in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. Any gas fees involved in claiming the airdrop will not count as cost for the purposes of resolving this market. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by May 31, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.",

If a majority of users are unable to withdraw their ETH from Binance, it will satisfy the condition.)\n\nIf Binance.com suspends withdrawals on a day in the last week of January (e.g. They halt token withdrawals on January 30, 2023, 4 PM ET), this market will not resolve until either: 1) withdrawals are reenabled before 7 full days (168 hours) pass, resulting in a \"No\" resolution; 2) 7 full days pass (Jan 30 - Feb 6, 2023, 4 PM ET) where withdrawals are suspended, resulting in a \"Yes\" resolution.",

      "question": "Arbitrum airdrop by March 31st?",
      "description": "In Response to Trader Inquiry: This market still resolves to \"Yes\" if users need to pay a standard gas fee to claim the airdrop.\n\nThis is a market on whether Arbitrum (https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by March 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet (any Arbitrum mainnet in this case, currently Arbitrum One and/or Arbitrum Nova), actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (either mainnet, in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by March 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.\n",

      "description": "'Scream VI' (2023) is an upcoming American horror mystery thriller film co-directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin. It is the sixth installment of the Scream series, and follows the survivors of the Ghostface killings as they leave Woodsboro behind to start a fresh chapter in New York City. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on March 10, 2023.\n\nThis is a market on how much ‘Scream VI' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1714914049/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Mar 10 - 12) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ‘Scream VI’ grosses more than $40,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 27, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

Fury of the Gods' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt10151854/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Mar 17 - 19) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ‘Shazam! Fury of the Gods’ grosses more than $25,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by April 3, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.",

Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. \n\nThe resolution data for January 7 will be checked on January 8, 2023 (12 PM ET), and can only resolve after the check. If for any reason (e.g. error, no data taken, etc.) there is no data point for January 7 on the check time, the market will be checked 6 hours later, at 6 PM ET on January 8, 2023. If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to January 7. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to January 7. Please note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”. \n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date.\n\nChanges in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market.   \n\nThe resolution data for December 29 will be checked on December 30, 2022 (12 PM ET), and can only resolve after the check. \n\nIf for any reason (e.g. error, no data taken, etc.) there is no data point for December 29 on the check time, the market will be checked 6 hours later, at 6 PM ET on December 30, 2022. If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

        "description": "A prediction market on whether Russia will use nuclear weapons has been requested many times recently by esteemed academics and thought leaders from across the world, and it is strongly within the public's interest to have accurate price discovery and realtime forecasts on such a topic. Existing prediction markets on this subject lack functional price discovery mechanisms, and thus are misleading the people; therefore it was deemed necessary to support this market as a public good, in order to provide clarity to society on one of the most pressing issues.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the Russian Federation detonates a nuclear device in an offensive capacity by June 30, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nTo satisfy a \"Yes\" resolution, the detonation of a nuclear device must be in an offensive capacity (whether deliberate or accidental), must not be a test, and must be either claimed by the Russian Federation or considered by a preponderance of credible reporting and/or information from credible sources to be from the Russian Federation.\n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, determination as to whether a detonation was nuclear will be made by a preponderance of credible reporting.",

        "question": "zkSync airdrop by June 1?",
        "description": "This is a market on whether zkSync (https://zksync.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by June 1, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet, actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet, but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by June 1, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.",

If uninsured depositors are made whole via any other method (i.e. government bailout, merger or acquisition, etc.), this market will also resolve to “Yes.” \n\nIf depositors are not made whole by June 30, 2023, the market will resolve to “No.” \n\nThe resolution source will be the FDIC, other government-related entities direct reporting, and SVB direct reporting.

        "description": "This is a market on whether Metamask (https://metamask.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by December 31, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet (any mainnet in this case), actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (any mainnet, in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. Any gas fees involved in claiming the airdrop will not count as cost for the purposes of resolving this market. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by May 31, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.",

        "description": "In Response to Trader Inquiry: This market still resolves to \"Yes\" if users need to pay a standard gas fee to claim the airdrop.\n\nThis is a market on whether Arbitrum (https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by March 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet (any Arbitrum mainnet in this case, currently Arbitrum One and/or Arbitrum Nova), actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (either mainnet, in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token’s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by March 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to “No”.\n",
